## Manage Portal Users

Portals users can 'Register' on the portal or be setup by an admin user in the main app. 

### Registration on Portal 
By default 'Account/Company Name' and 'Account Number' are the variables used to validate a user. Other variables can be configured upon request, for example, email and/or a number can be added. All variables configured will be used for the one time payment as well.
